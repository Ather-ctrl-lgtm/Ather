Let’s go step by step   
We’ll use SQL (Oracle / MySQL compatible syntax) to create tables and perform the queries. 
 
  Create Tables 
CREATE TABLE Engg_Course ( 
    Course_id INT PRIMARY KEY, 
    Subject_name VARCHAR(50), 
    Branch VARCHAR(50), 
    Class VARCHAR(20), 
    Collegename VARCHAR(50) 
); 
 
CREATE TABLE HonorsCourse ( 
    Honor_course_id INT PRIMARY KEY, 
    Course_id INT, 
    Subject_name VARCHAR(50), 
    Class VARCHAR(20), 
    FOREIGN KEY (Course_id) REFERENCES Engg_Course(Course_id) 
); 
 
  Insert Sample Data 
INSERT INTO Engg_Course VALUES  
(101, 'DBMS', 'Computer', 'SE', 'KBTCOE'), 
(102, 'OS', 'Computer', 'TE', 'KBTCOE'), 
(103, 'Maths', 'Mechanical', 'FE', 'KBTCOE'), 
(104, 'AI', 'Computer', 'BE', 'KBTCOE'); 
 
INSERT INTO HonorsCourse VALUES  
(1, 101, 'DBMS', 'SE'), 
(2, 104, 'AI', 'BE'), 
(3, 105, 'Data Science', 'BE'); 
 
  INNER JOIN 
(Shows only rows that have matching Course_id in both tables) 
SELECT  
    E.Course_id,  
    E.Subject_name AS Engg_Subject,  
    H.Subject_name AS Honor_Subject,  
    E.Class 
FROM Engg_Course E 
INNER JOIN HonorsCourse H 
ON E.Course_id = H.Course_id; 
 
  LEFT OUTER JOIN 
(Returns all records from Engg_Course, and matching ones from HonorsCourse) 
SELECT  
    E.Course_id,  
    E.Subject_name AS Engg_Subject,  
    H.Subject_name AS Honor_Subject,  
    E.Class 
FROM Engg_Course E 
LEFT OUTER JOIN HonorsCourse H 
ON E.Course_id = H.Course_id; 
 
  RIGHT OUTER JOIN 
(Returns all records from HonorsCourse, and matching ones from Engg_Course) 
SELECT  
    E.Course_id,  
    E.Subject_name AS Engg_Subject,  
    H.Subject_name AS Honor_Subject,  
    H.Class 
FROM Engg_Course E 
RIGHT OUTER JOIN HonorsCourse H 
ON E.Course_id = H.Course_id; 
 
  FULL OUTER JOIN 
(Returns all records from both tables — match or no match) 
Note: MySQL doesn’t support FULL OUTER JOIN directly, but Oracle and SQL Server do. For MySQL, use UNION of LEFT + RIGHT join. 
In Oracle / SQL Server: 
SELECT  
    E.Course_id,  
    E.Subject_name AS Engg_Subject,  
    H.Subject_name AS Honor_Subject,  
    E.Class 
FROM Engg_Course E 
FULL OUTER JOIN HonorsCourse H 
ON E.Course_id = H.Course_id; 
In MySQL (alternative way): 
SELECT  
    E.Course_id,  
    E.Subject_name AS Engg_Subject,  
    H.Subject_name AS Honor_Subject,  
    E.Class 
FROM Engg_Course E 
LEFT JOIN HonorsCourse H ON E.Course_id = H.Course_id 
UNION 
SELECT  
    E.Course_id,  
    E.Subject_name AS Engg_Subject,  
    H.Subject_name AS Honor_Subject,  
    E.Class 
FROM Engg_Course E 
RIGHT JOIN HonorsCourse H ON E.Course_id = H.Course_id; 
 
  Create a VIEW on Engg_Course 
(Only with Subject_name, Branch, Class) 
CREATE VIEW Engg_View AS 
SELECT Subject_name, Branch, Class 
FROM Engg_Course; 
 
  Display the VIEW 
SELECT * FROM Engg_View; 
 
  Delete Two Tuples from the VIEW 
You can delete from a view only if it is updatable (simple view on a single table — yes, this one is). 
DELETE FROM Engg_View 
WHERE Subject_name = 'DBMS'; 
 
DELETE FROM Engg_View 
WHERE Subject_name = 'AI'; 
 
  Summary 
Task Query Type 	Command 
1 INNER JOIN 	SELECT ... INNER JOIN ... 
2 LEFT OUTER JOIN 	SELECT ... LEFT JOIN ... 
3 RIGHT OUTER JOIN SELECT ... RIGHT JOIN ... 
4 FULL OUTER JOIN FULL JOIN or UNION 
5 CREATE VIEW 	CREATE VIEW Engg_View AS ... 
6 Display View 	SELECT * FROM Engg_View; 
7 Delete 	DELETE FROM Engg_View WHERE ... 
 
Would you like me to also draw a diagram showing the table relationships (with primary & foreign keys)? It’ll help you visualize the joins better.
